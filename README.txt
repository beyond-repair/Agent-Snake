AI Agent README

This AI agent has been trained using machine learning techniques to write Python code, including downloading dependencies and running the code. To use the AI agent, follow the instructions below:

1. Install the necessary dependencies for creating and training an AI agent in Python.
2. Develop and train a neural network using machine learning techniques.
3. Develop and code the AI agent using Python and the selected machine learning algorithm. Develop a neural network model for the AI agent using machine learning techniques.
4. Train the AI agent using the neural network model to write Python code, including downloading dependencies and running the code. Train the AI agent using machine learning techniques to code in Python. Train the AI agent using relevant data sets and optimize its performance.
5. Integrate the AI agent as a module into Autogpt and ensure it can write and execute Python code from start to finish.

To optimize the performance of the AI agent, consider training it using additional data sets or adjusting the machine learning algorithm. For more information, refer to the train_agent.py file.
